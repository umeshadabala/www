    The World Wide Web -- also known as the web, WWW or W3 -- refers to all the public
    <br>
    websites or pages that users can access on their local computers and other devices through
    <br>
    the internet. These pages and documents are interconnected by means of hyperlinks that
    <br>
    users click on for information. This information can be in different formats, including text,
    <br>
    images, audio and video.Most web documents and pages are created using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),
    <br>
    a text-based way of describing how content within an HTML file is structured.
    <br>
    HTML describes the structure of web pages using elements or tags and displays the
    <br>
    content of these pages through a web browser.

    The development of the World Wide Web was begun in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee and his colleagues at CERN,
    <br>
    an international scientific organization based in Geneva, Switzerland. They created a protocol,
    <br>
    HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which standardized communication between servers and clients.
    <br>
    Their text-based Web browser was made available for general release in January 1992.
    <br>
    In 1989 Tim Berners Lee and his team  has re-designed SGML and named it HTML.

    Tim Berners-Lee, in full Sir Tim Berners-Lee, (born June 8, 1955, London, England),
    <br>
    British computer scientist, generally credited as the inventor of the World Wide Web.
    <br>
    In 2004 he was awarded a knighthood by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom and the
    <br>
    inaugural Millennium Technology Prize (€1 million) by the Finnish Technology Award Foundation.

    From 1991 to 1993 Berners-Lee evangelized the Web. In 1994 in the United States he
    <br>
    established the World Wide Web (W3) Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s
    <br>
    Laboratory for Computer Science. The consortium, in consultation with others, lends oversight
    <br>
    to the Web and the development of standards. In 1999 Berners-Lee became the first holder of the
    <br>
    3Com Founders chair at the Laboratory for Computer Science. His numerous other honours included
    <br>
    the National Academy of Engineering’s prestigious Charles Stark Draper Prize (2007).
    <Br>
    Berners-Lee was the author, along with Mark Fischetti, of Weaving the Web: The Original Design
    <Br>
    and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web (2000).

    1.In college, Berners-Lee built a computer out of an old television set.
    <br>
    <br>
    2.Before settling on “the Web,” Berners-Lee thought of the names “Information Mesh”,
    <br>
    “The Information Mine”, and “Mine of Information”.
    <br>
    <br>
    3.In 1990, Berners-Lee wrote the first browser and editor, called “WorldWideWeb.app,”
    <br>
    which ran on a NeXT computer. Steve Jobs had left Apple to create NeXT Inc., and later returned to Apple.
    <br>
    <br>
    4.WorldWideWeb, which took 2 months to write, was also an editor, so the earliest vision of the Web
    <br>
    was one where anyone could contribute.
    <br>
    <br>
    5.The first Web site was info.cern.ch, hosted by CERN, on Tim’s desktop computer.
    <br>
    <br>
    6.The early Web pages from 1992 were preserved by Berners-Lee and W3C, but CERN did
    <br>
    not serve them at theoriginal address until in April 2013.
    <br>
    <br>
    7.On 30 April 1993, CERN put WorldWideWeb in the public domain, a critical milestone
    <br>
    in enabling broad adoption of the Web.
    <br>
    <br>
    8.In 2004, W3C adopted an industry-leading Royalty-Free patent policy to further Berners-Lee’s
    <br>
    vision of the Web as an open platform for innovation.
    <br>
    <br>
    9.65.6 percent of the entire world's population has internet access
